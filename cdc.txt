 - test task 1 : make a led blink
 - test task 2 : communicate with the user
   - development of a mini-shell ?
   - management of the I/O from the software
 - scheduler and process management
 - system calls and API of the OS :

   - user I/O (using the serial port or other means)
     - system task to manage the I/O ?
   - functions like malloc, etc...

 - support of the RAM chip on the FPGA to have more than 2 ko of memory.
 - support of the I/O we need for the permanent storage
 - support of a serial port or any other peripheral to communicate with the user

Compiler
 - CRAPS assembly backend
 - make the source language as much similar as C
