  \section{Introduction}
    This project, suggested by Daniel Hagimont, is based on the CRAPS processor
    developed by Jean-Christophe Buisson and used in the first-year CPU
    architecture courses at ENSEEIHT. The goal is to develop an operating
    system that would run on top of that processor.

    The reasons for that project are that before, it was only possible to do a
    little of assembly directly on the processor to see it work, but nothing
    more.  After our project, it should be possible for students to really see
    the layer that goes on top of the CPU in modern computers: the operating
    system. So that the students can really make the link between the processor
    they just built and the computer and underlying operating systems they use
    everyday.
