  \section{Introduction and Objectives}
    This document presents the testing strategies we used to test the tools
    produced for the CRAPS Kernel project. Three main tools have to be tested:
    \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
      \item the processor,
      \item the compiler,
      \item the kernel itself.
    \end{inparaenum}

    The tests for these tools are independent. But the kernel depends on both
    the processor and the compiler.

  \section{Objectives}
    \subsection{Processor Tests}
      The goals of these tests is to prove that every processor instruction
      works as intended. We will only test the features we have added to the
      processor given by Jean-Christophe Buisson, since he has already tested
      this version.

      Stress tests for the RS-232 will be needed to check that no data is lost.

    \subsection{Compiler Tests}
      The goals of these tests is to prove the code generated by the compiler is
      correct. We will have to tests every \textit{C} structure the compiler
      supports.

    \subsection{Kernel Tests}
      The goals of these tests is to prove the kernel is correct.
