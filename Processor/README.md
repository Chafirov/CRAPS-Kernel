# Processor
## About 
This processor is a CRAPS processor : a simplified version of the Sun's SPARC processor.
You can find a complete description of the CRAPS [here](doc/craps.pdf).
[Here](ISE_project) is a VHDL implementation of the CRAPS written for a Digilent Nexys4 board.

## How to
Simply add these .vhd files to a ISE's (or Verilog's) project, synthetise and generate .bin file.
In the ISE environment, you have to use !IMPACT (Tools --> IMPACT) wizard to configure the board : 

- Launch IMPACT
- Click on Boundary Scan
- Right click on the dedicated panel and select "Initialize Chain" (or CTRL+i)
- Click "Yes" to assign a configuration file
- Select the .bin file generated by ISE
- Click "No" for ROM configuration
- Click "Ok"
- Finaly click right on the device and choose "Program" on the items' list on the left

The CRAPS is now well configured on the board, you can [load the OS kernel](../Utils/README.md).
