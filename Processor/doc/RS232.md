RS-232
======

New memory mapping
------------------

The memory address `0xD0000000` is mapped to the last byte received by the
RS-232.
Anything written to the address `0xD0000001` is sent through the RS-232 (you
will need to way for the byte to be sent!).

Interruption
------------

The interrupt 5 is triggered when a byte has been fully received. The byte will
be available in address `0xD0000000` until another byte is received.

The interrupt 6 was supposed to be triggered when a byte can be written (ie.
when a byte has been sent and the processor is ready to send another). This
does not work though: the processor blocks anytime we want to map the
corresponding bit from the VHDL module.

Settings
--------

The module expects 9600 bauds and an odd parity.
